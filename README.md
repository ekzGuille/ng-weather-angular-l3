# NgWeather

### This project is an improvement of the base project: [NgWeather](https://github.com/alcfeoh/ng-weather).
#### All completed tasks of the [document](https://bit.ly/at-cert-lv3-weather) are in the `master` branch. But they are also in three different branches:
* `feature/step-1`
* `feature/step-2`
* `feature/step-3`

### Demo: [Vercel](https://ng-weather-angular-l3.vercel.app/)
